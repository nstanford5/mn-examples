/**
 * DUST fee sponsorship — reference implementation.
 *
 * On Midnight, transaction fees are paid in DUST, and DUST is *generated* by NIGHT
 * that has been registered for DUST generation. It is not transferable. So a wallet
 * holding unregistered NIGHT — or no NIGHT at all — has zero DUST and cannot submit
 * any transaction, even one that moves no funds.
 *
 * Sponsorship lets a second wallet pay that fee without gaining any ability to act
 * on the first wallet's behalf. The split is enforced by `tokenKindsToBalance`:
 *
 *   USER     balances ['shielded', 'unshielded']   — its own value, then signs + binds
 *   SPONSOR  balances ['dust']                     — the fee only, then signs + submits
 *
 * Order matters. The user proves, balances, signs and FINALIZES first. What crosses
 * the wire is a bound `FinalizedTransaction`: the sponsor can add a DUST fee offer to
 * it, and nothing else. The sponsor never sees the user's private circuit inputs,
 * because the user — not the sponsor — generated the proof.
 *
 * The two halves are deliberately split into two functions with a hex string between
 * them. That string is the network boundary: in production `prepareSponsoredCall`
 * runs in the user's browser and `sponsorAndSubmit` runs on the sponsor's server.
